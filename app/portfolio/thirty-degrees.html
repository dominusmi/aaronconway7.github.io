        <p class="fact desc">Thirty Degrees is a digital agency founded by myself and a few friends. It was created as an oppurtunity for all of us to take on large web development projects that we couldn't manage individually. We have had a number of cliets including Fanbytes, Eamonn & Co, The Panoptic and Fire Door Inpection Solutions UK. Our own website is currently in development. </p>
