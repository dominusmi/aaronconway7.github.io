        <p class="fact desc">NDORSA is a startup founded by myself and couple other friends. It is the ultimate marketplace to find social media endorsers/influencers. When I was introduced to this idea by the CEO, I was immediately taken by the project and the possibilities. I am responsible for the design and front-end development of the platform as well as the marketing assets. The platform has been built on PHP and is coming soon.</p>
