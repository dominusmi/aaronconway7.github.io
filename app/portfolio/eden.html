        <p class="fact desc">Eden was by 3rd year dissertation project. It is a front-end framework for beautiful design offering both CSS and JS components. My main reason for creating my own framework was to suit my personal design style and to save time during development. It is freely available on github as an open-source project having being used in a handful of sites online. Eden was made using SASS, jQuery and Gulp.</p>
