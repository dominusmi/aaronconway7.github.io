                p.fact.desc Mepiphany was a platform to connect students and employers. The brief of forming a brand for the company consisted of creating a minimilistic logo and other assets, encorporating the idea of a light bulb and a blue colour scheme. Unfortunately Mepiphany no longer exists. These assets were designed and created in Adobe Illustrator.
