The brief of forming a brand for the company consisted of creating a minimilistic logo and other assets, encorporating the idea of a light bulb and a blue colour scheme.

These assets were designed and created in Adobe Illustrator.</p></div></div><div class="col gallery"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/mepiphany/logo.png" alt="Mepiphany Logo"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/mepiphany/poster.jpg" alt="Mepiphany Cover Photo"></div></div></div>
